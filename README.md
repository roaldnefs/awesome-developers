	<sub>Please, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/roaldnefs/awesome-developers/blob/main/BADGES.md">BADGES.md</a> to know what the badges mean. The order of the developers doesn't mean the quality: all of the developers below are awesome. Every developer is in a specific section/subsection, though it may involve other topics that are not the ones according to the section (but the section the developer is in is its main content). Note that this <strong>is not</strong> a promotional list of any kind. Check also the <a href="https://github.com/roaldnefs/awesome-developers/discussions">Discussions</a> section to read and discuss topics about this list and repository.
